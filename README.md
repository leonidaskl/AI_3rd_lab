# AI_3rd_lab

In this exercise, various machine learning algorithms have been implemented for the automatic recognition between 3 types of music from the data provided by the Spotify service.
We had to build three algorithms ( KNN, Naive Bayes and Multilayer Percepton ) and compare them with the ready ones from libraries.
